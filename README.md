# PROG209-HW7.5 Using git and GitHub in Linux

## Instructions
For this weeks homework, Prog 209 HW 7 - Make <li>'s active and Serve App from a node.js server, when you are done, just compress the file (it will be a *.tar.gz file and submit that to Canvas from within your Linux system)

What you need to do on your linux system is create an SSH private key, and then register that on Github.  Then you are to re-submit the same homework, Prog 209 HW 7 - Make <li>'s active and Serve App from a node.js server but this time by posting a github link, not a compressed file.

Here are the steps to do that: https://youtu.be/8X4u9sca3Io
